Requires at least: 2.9.2
Tested up to: 3.0.1

== Description ==

Allows simple management of sticky posts from a centralized admin panel.

= Features =

* Manage sticky posts from centralized admin panel (under "Posts")
* AJAX search to quickly add posts (thanks, Microkid!)
* Easily "unstick" current sticky posts

= Acknowledgements =

I'm greatly indebted to Microkid (microkid.net) for the AJAX search form (from his Related Posts plugin), which is reproduced here with only slight modifications. The CSS from that plugin was also used as a jumping-off point for this one. 

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip,
1. Put the related-posts folder in your wp-content/plugins folder,
1. Activate the plugin through the Wordpress admin,
1. The user interface is available in the WordPress admin as the submenu "Manage Stickies" (under "Posts").

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

No questions yet. I'm all ears.

== Screenshots ==
1. The plugin's control panel appears as a submenu of "Posts" in the WordPress admin. This screenshot shows the total functionality: Posts already marked as sticky appear in the top table. Other posts can be marked sticky by searching for them using the form below. "Live" results appear as you type in the left box. Selecting a result item copies it over to the box on the right. Clicking "Save Changes" marks the selected posts as sticky (they'll appear in the top table)). Posts can be "unstuck" by selecting the check box next to a particular item in the "Current Sticky Posts" table and clicking "Save Changes."
